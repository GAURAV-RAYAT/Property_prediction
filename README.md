# Project Title: Property Price Prediction in Delhi Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The "Property Price Prediction in Delhi" project leverages machine learning techniques to accurately predict real estate prices in Delhi based on various input features. Utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn, this project implements methods including One-Hot Encoding, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees to develop robust prediction models. By analyzing historical data and relevant property attributes, the project aims to provide a reliable tool for forecasting property prices, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and transforming categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Two primary models are employed:
  - **Linear Regression**: A fundamental regression technique that models the relationship between dependent and independent variables linearly.
  - **Decision Trees**: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure for prediction.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The models are trained on a dataset of Delhi property prices and evaluated using various metrics to ensure accuracy and performance. Techniques like cross-validation are used to validate the models.
- **User Input Handling**: The system accepts various input parameters such as location, number of bedrooms, size (in square feet), and other relevant features to predict the property price.

## Implementation Details
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (optional): For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
  
## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical property price data from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive dataset that includes all necessary features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and apply One-Hot Encoding to transform categorical variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify and select relevant features that significantly impact property prices.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Train a Linear Regression model to establish a baseline prediction.
   - Develop a Decision Tree model to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to evaluate model performance.
6. **Prediction Interface**: Create an interface for users to input property details and receive price predictions.

## Potential Use Cases
- **Real Estate Investment**: Help investors assess the potential value of properties and make informed investment decisions.
- **Market Analysis**: Provide insights into property market trends and price fluctuations in different areas of Delhi.
- **Personal Use**: Assist home buyers and sellers in determining fair market prices for properties.

## Future Enhancements
- **Incorporate Additional Models**: Experiment with advanced models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks for improved accuracy.
- **Expand Dataset**: Continuously update the dataset with the latest property prices and features to enhance model performance.
- **Geographical Visualization**: Integrate geographical information systems (GIS) to visualize property prices on a map of Delhi.

This project aims to bring data-driven insights into the real estate market of Delhi, providing a valuable tool for various stakeholders involved in property transactions.
